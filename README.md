My Rubik's Chess project is play-able here! https://htwins.net/rubikschess/

I demonstrated how this game works in this YouTube video! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQDTl9qyfLA

Recent changes on March 27, 2024:
- Knights' paths now work correctly near corners, allowing the L-bend to cross multiple boundaries at once.
- Pieces no longer flicker for one frame when they reach their destination.
- When the "Go over edges" feature is turned off, Hands are now able to still do their Rubik's-slice-turning moves.
- When the "Go over edges" feature is turned off, there is now a thick black border around each square face, indicating that pieces can't cross it.
- When you click outside the cube entirely, selection now successfully disappears.
- When a piece has two sliding directions that intersect (like a queen), and you choose a destination after the intersection, the animation for movement BEFORE the intersection now chooses the correct path (instead of picking the incorrect one and pivoting at the intersection).
